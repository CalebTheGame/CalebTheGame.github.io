# Federico's self-help zone.

Hi, I Am Federico, a Ph. D. in Engineering of Information.

During my activity, I had often to learn some new technology or API or tool. Well, this experience taught me a very useful lesson:

**YOU WILL ALWAYS FORGET HOW TO USE WHAT YOU STOP TO USE!**

Then, after realizing that to look for documentation and re-learn what you ALREADY spent time to learn is very frustrating and, obviously, a total waste of time.

My first try was to keep some self-made annotations in paper or .docs. This taught me a second, painful, lesson:

**YOU WILL ALWAYS LOSE NOTES STORED UNSAFELY!**

So, after spending a month in learning `spark.ml` libraries in order to perform some Map-Reduce tasks, i decided to start this blog to basically DON'T SPEND AGAIN ALL THE TIME and collect all the learned information in a shared place (to eventually help one of my 7 doubles around the world).



Hope you'll find this posts useful.



Have a nice coding.
